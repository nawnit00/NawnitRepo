Adding a user

If you intend to share these repositories with any collaborators, at this point you’ll either:
•Want to install something like Gitosis (outside the scope of this article, but this is a good, if old, tutorial); or
•Add a “shared” Git user.

We’ll be following the latter option. So, add a Git user:
sudo adduser git

Now you’ll need to add your public key to the Git user’s authorized_keys:
sudo mkdir /home/git/.ssh
sudo cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/git/.ssh/
sudo chown -R git:git /home/git/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 !$
sudo chmod 600 /home/git/.ssh/*


Now you’ll be able to authenticate as the Git user via SSH. Test it out:
ssh git@myserver.com

Add your repositories

If you were to not share the repositories, and just wanted to access them for yourself (like I did, since I have no collaborators), you’d do the following as yourself. Otherwise, do it as the Git user we added above.

If using the Git user, log in as them:

login git

Now we can create our repositories:
mkdir myrepo.git
cd !$
git --bare init
-------------------------------------
ssh -T git@github.com
